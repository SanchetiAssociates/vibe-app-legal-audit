# vibe-app-legal-audit

A free, open-source pre-launch legal-exposure scanner and Claude skill for web and mobile apps (especially AI-generated "vibe coded" apps). It scans a codebase for nine patterns that create per-user or per-email statutory exposure under **US**, **Indian** and **EU** rules. Then it guides the fixes that code can solve.

> **This is a checklist and not legal advice.** Laws differ by state and country. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanchetiAssociates/vibe-app-legal-audit.git
python vibe-app-legal-audit/scripts/scan.py /path/to/your/project --md audit.md --json audit.json
```

- Python 3.8 or later. No dependencies. It reads files only and makes no network calls.
- Exit code `1` means at least one HIGH finding. Exit code `0` means none.
- The scanner is regex based. Every hit is a lead that needs a human check. A PASS means nothing was found and not that the app is compliant.

## Use as a Claude skill

Copy this folder to `~/.claude/skills/vibe-app-legal-audit/` (Claude Code) or upload the folder as a skill in Claude settings. Then ask: "Audit this app for legal exposure". Claude runs the scanner, confirms each lead by reading the code, applies the code-level fixes and lists the owner actions that code cannot do (for example registering a DMCA agent).

The full instruction set is in [audit_prompt.md](audit_prompt.md). You can paste it into any assistant that can read your project.

## Use in GitHub Actions

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: SanchetiAssociates/vibe-app-legal-audit@v1
  with:
    path: .
    fail-on-high: "true"
```

## Limits

- Heuristic detection. Expect false positives and false negatives.
- It cannot see third-party dashboards, CMS settings, build output or server config.
- Penalty figures in the references are statutory maximums and not typical outcomes.
- Law changes. Check dates in the reference files and verify items marked K on official portals.
